Overview
--------

Learn how to use a **change data capture (CDC) handler** to replicate data with the
{+mkc+}. A CDC handler is a program that translates CDC events into MongoDB
write operations. Use a CDC handler when you need to reproduce the changes in
one datastore into another datastore.

In this tutorial, you use a CDC handler to make two MongoDB collections
contain the same documents.

If you want to learn more about how CDC handlers work rather than view
a tutorial that demonstrates how you use them, see the
:ref:`<sink-fundamentals-cdc-handler>` guide.
