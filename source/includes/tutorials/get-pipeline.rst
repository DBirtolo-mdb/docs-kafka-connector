We provide a sandbox that includes the services you need to build your sample data pipeline.

To download the sandbox, clone the tutorial repository to your development environment. Then navigate to the directory that corresponds to the quick start example. If you use bash or a similar shell, use the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/mongodb-university/kafka-edu.git
   cd kafka-edu/docs-examples/examples/v1.6/quickstart
