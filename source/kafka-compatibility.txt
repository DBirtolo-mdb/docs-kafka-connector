MongoDB Compatibility
---------------------

Kafka Sink Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Kafka Sink Connector** requires MongoDB 3.6 or later; it is
unsupported for older versions of MongoDB.

Kafka Source Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Kafka Source Connector** requires MongoDB 3.6 or later as your data
source if you are using change streams with a **collection** only. If you
need to watch a **database** or **deployment**, you need MongoDB 4.0 or
later.

.. note::

   The MongoDB Connector for Apache Kafka is only tested against MongoDB
   clusters. If you use the MongoDB Kafka connector with a non-genuine
   MongoDB database, it may not function correctly due to differences in
   features or feature behavior.

Kafka Compatibility
-------------------

The **MongoDB Connector for Apache Kafka** requires Apache Kafka Connect
API version 2.1.0 or later. The MongoDB Connector can be used with the
following Kafka-compatibile platforms:

- Confluent Platform 5.3 or later
- Microsoft Azure Event Hubs
- Red Hat AMQ Streams

.. note::

   The MongoDB Connector for Apache Kafka is only tested against the
   platforms mentioned above. If you use the MongoDB Kafka connector with
   a Kafka-compatible platform that is *not* listed above, it may not
   function correctly due to differences in features or feature behavior.
