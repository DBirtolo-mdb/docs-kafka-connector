MongoDB Compatibility
---------------------

Kafka Sink Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Kafka Sink Connector** requires MongoDB 3.6 or later.

Kafka Source Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Kafka Source Connector** requires MongoDB 3.6 or later. 

If you are using MongoDB 3.6, the connector can only listen for
changes on **collections**. If you need the connector to listen for
changes on a **database** or **deployment**, you must use
MongoDB 4.0 or later.

.. note::

   We recommend that you only use the {+mkc+} with an official version
   of the MongoDB server. We cannot guarantee it functions correctly
   with any other version.

Kafka Compatibility
-------------------

The **{+mkc+}** requires Kafka Connect version 2.1.0 or later. It's
tested against Apache Kafka 2.3 and later. You can use the Kafka
Connect service with several Apache Kafka compatible platforms including
the following:

- Confluent Platform 5.3 or later
- Microsoft Azure Event Hubs
- Red Hat AMQ Streams

The {+mkc+} works directly with Kafka Connect. The connector does not
connect directly to a Kafka cluster which means it's compatible with any
Apache Kafka platform that supports Kafka Connect.

If you have any questions about the {+mkc+}, feel free to ask them on
the `MongoDB Community Forums
<https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/c/data/connectors-integrations/>`__.
